# rails 3.1 rc4, ruby 1.9.2-290, sqlite3 for db
# assets contains images, js, styles instead of in public folder - easier for sass and coffeescript to work

# /config has routes.rb, if u want to use mysql need to configure database.yml
# /db will contain a generated migration once something gets run

# /test for test::unit, but not rspec

# sass compiles down into css, no brackets just spacing
# scss is a newer version of sass, brackets added back

# in .haml, change javascript include from "defaults" to "application"

#nifty scaffolding generates less usesless code than default rails scaffolding
